# Critique of NFTs for prospective artists

My mom teaches art history and her students (many of them graphic designers)
have inquired about NFTs and whether they are a legitimate form of art.  Both of
us are skeptical about NFTs, but she's not as technical, so she reached out to
me for help explaining them and resources that are informed critiques of NFTs.
I in turn also
[reached out to my Twitter network](https://twitter.com/GabriellaG439/status/1482432122350493702)
to help me compile a list of resources for this purpose.

This post will not explain NFTs *per se* but will instead be a survey that links
to related resources critiquing NFTs and attempts to market them to artists and
game designers.

Also, feel free to submit a pull request editing or expanding upon this post.
You can treat this like a collaborative wiki.

## Introductions to NFTs and their underlying technology

  > that NFTs are the future or art and any gamer who heard the same about video
  > games. For anyone who got some lecture about how the future of the web would
  > be built on this new tech that feels hard to grasp. For anyone who’s being
  > bombarded with investment opportunities in NFTs that sound way too good to
  > be true.

## Other summaries and surveys

* [/u/NoahDiesSlowly explains the problems with NFTs](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/rho91b/whats_up_with_the_nft_hate/horr549/)

  `/u/Zombiehype` asked "What's up with the NFT hate?" on `/r/OutOfTheLoop` and
  `/u/NoahDiesSlowly` succinctly summarizes the most common criticisms of NFTs.

* [Why NFTs are bad: the long version](https://antsstyle.medium.com/why-nfts-are-bad-the-long-version-2c16dae145e2)

## Technical limitations of NFTs

* [My first impressions of web3](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html)

  This post criticizes the technical underpinnings behind NFTs and shows that
  the marketing behind them is detached from the technical reality.

  This article written by a game designer explains the fundamental issues with
  game industry proposals to adopt NFTs.  Yes, that is the actual title.

## The NFT community does not respect or protect artists

* [Content Creators Are Having Their Pictures And YouTube Channels Stolen And Sold As NFTs](https://www.thegamer.com/opensea-nft-stolen-art-pictures-youtubers-streamers/)

  This article explains how NFTs do not protect content creators.  Quite the
  opposite: they commonly profit off of their content without their consent and
  disrespect them along the way:

  > YouTubers Jim Sterling and Caddicarus are among the first to notice their
  > channels being sold online, in a move that they're labelling "pathetic",
  > "disrespectful" and "exploitative". Sony Santa Monica Studios' Alanah
  > Pearce has also had her pictures stolen and sold on the site, with the
  > sellers going a step further than theft, and photoshopping the game dev onto
  > a porn magazine cover.

## NFT-related fraud

* [Web3 is going just great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/)

  This site catalogs rampant fraud within the NFT ecosystem.

* [NFTs Are a Pyramid Scheme and People Are Already Losing Money](https://fstoppers.com/opinion/nfts-are-pyramid-scheme-and-people-are-already-losing-money-554869)

  > On the surface, the NFT marketplace is made to look like everyone is making

  > one dictum it cannot escape: for someone to make money, another has to lose
  > money. NFTs do not magically generate wealth from nowhere; they’re taking it

* [NFT “Sells” for Over $500 Million Back to Original Owner in Apparent “WASH,” Potentially Heightening Securities Concerns in This Emerging Market](https://www.winston.com/en/the-playbook/nft-sells-for-over-500-million-back-to-original-owner-in-apparent-wash-potentially-heightening-securities-concerns-in-this-emerging-market.html)

  This documents an example of "wash trading", a common form of NFT fraud where
  people buy their NFT from themselves to inflate the perceived value.  Wash
  trading is illegal, by the way.

  > $532,414,877.01. As expected, the buyer, who used “flash loans” to acquire
  > the funds to purchase the NFT, sent the Ethereum to the seller, who in turn
  > sent the NFT memorializing the ownership of CryptoPunk 9998 to the buyer.
  > However, as part of the same transaction, the seller then sent the Ethereum
  > back to the buyer, who repaid his loans. Finally, the “Punk” was sent back
  > to the original owner, who quickly listed it for sale again at nearly double
  > the original price, 250,000 Ethereum (over $1 billion).

## NFTs are not art

* [The NFT's Aura, or, Why Is NFT Art So Ugly?](https://www.stormingtheivorytower.com/2021/06/the-nfts-aura-or-why-is-nft-art-so-ugly.html)

  This post explains why NFT art tends to be ugly and devoid of artistic
  merit:

  > It's actually very difficult to talk about NFT art as art because most of
  > it is so god damn ugly, vapid, and amateurish. NFT art is like, imagine if
  > you took a bunch of dudes in a high school art fair, then put them in an
  > echo chamber for a decade that constantly told them that everything they

## NFTs are harmful to the environment

  This article explains why NFTs are harmful for the environment.  Yes, that is
  the actual title.

## NFTs are a net social negative

* [Brian Eno on NFTs & Automaticism](https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/brian-eno-on-nfts-and-automatism/)

  This is an interview of an artist explaining his misgivings about NFTs and
  their benefit to society:

  > I am trying to keep an open mind about these questions. People I like and
  > trust are convinced they’re the best thing since sliced bread, so I wish I
  > could have a more positive view but right now I mainly see hustlers
  > looking for suckers. And lots of bright-eyed artists willing to play the
  > latter role. Forgive my cynicism… I’m not feeling too positive right now.

## Process/performance art about NFTs

Artists curious about NFTs might appreciate process art or performance art
critiquing NFTs:

  This is an article about someone orchestrating the greatest NFT "heist" of
  all time, downloading all of available NFTs and making them available via a
  torrent.
